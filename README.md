**By Zardoua Yassir, PhD in Computer Vision (yassirzardoua@gmail.com)**

This code implements a sea-sky line detection algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) based on the research presented in the paper:

*Sea-sky line detection using gray variation differences in the time domain for unmanned surface vehicles* by [Liu et al., J. Intell. Robot. Syst. (2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11760-020-01733-0).
